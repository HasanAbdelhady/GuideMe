NEW PARADIGM

AAAI21

Mainstream：Loss Function based 

Novel Paradigm：Self-Organizing  

Optimization

Dynamical Equations

Adaptation：Low。After 

convergence, learning is hindered.

Robustness: Low。Behavior changes 

strongly with noise [Su, Vargas, 
Sakurai IEEE Trans 2019]。

Adaptation: High。Even after equilibrium 

the system above is inherently adaptive  
[Vargas, Asabuki, AAAI2021]。

Robustness：High。Fluctuations in the 

input are not enough to bring the system 
out of the equilibrium state.

Wikipedia Single Version of Reality - From Larry Sanger  
(co-founder of Wikipedia) 

Social Media 
Problems (1)

• “Wikipedia is known now by everyone to have a lot 
of inﬂuence in the world. So there’s a very big, 
nasty, complex game being played behind the 
scenes to make the article say what somebody 
wants them to say.”


• “if only one version of the facts is allowed then that 
gives a huge incentive to wealthy and powerful 
people to seize control of things like Wikipedia in 
order to shore up their power. And they do that.”

Objectives

• [Facilitate Reasoning and Discussion] - Facilitate discussion in presentation 
and other live events. Reason with anyone anywhere and understand the 
reasoning underlining many common topics;


• [Turn Conﬂict into Construction] - This project envisions a society in which it is 

easy and fast to discuss multiple topics without getting into conﬂict. The 
objective is to turn our egocentric views of the world into pure reasoning;


• [Stopping Fake News] - AI and analysis-based algorithms to prevent spreading;


• [Allow Multiple Perspectives to Coexist] - Moreover, multiple perspectives will 
be present at the same time, fostering communication with people with diﬀerent 
beliefs through data and reasoning.
