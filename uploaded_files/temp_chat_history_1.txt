user: Let's start learning
assistant: I'm excited to start our learning session!

Before we begin, I'd like to clarify which learning approach you'd prefer to use today: Visual or Reading?
user: Visual
assistant: Let's use the Visual approach today!

To get started, can you please tell me what topic or subject you'd like to explore today? Is it something specific, like a particular concept or skill, or a broader area like science, history, or mathematics?

Also, would you like to focus on a specific type of visual content, such as diagrams, charts, mind maps, or infographics?
