Before we dive into our session on Deep Learning, I'd like to get a better sense of your preferred learning style. You mentioned earlier that you learn best through a combination of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic approaches. Which of these do you think you'd like to focus on for today's session? Would you like to start with something visual, auditory, or hands-on?

Please let me know, and we can tailor our approach to suit your needs!
