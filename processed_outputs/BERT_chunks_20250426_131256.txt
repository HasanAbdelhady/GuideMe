Slide 01 Introduction to BERTHASANABDELHADY A I E - 4 0 0 - NLP What is BERT? Slide 02 BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. It’s a model created by Google AI in 2018 to help computers understand human language better. It was a big breakthrough in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is all about teaching computers to read, understand, and respond to human language. What is BERT? Slide 03 What is BERT? BERTWASTRAINEDON: • THEENTIRETYOF WIKIPEDIA • 10s of thousands of books with a total of 3.3 Billion Words Why BERT? Slide 04 why bert? • Previous models read text one way (leftto-right or right-to-left) • BERT reads text both ways for better context understanding • Example: 'The bank is near the river' ⚬ Left to right misinterpretation How Does BERT Work? Slide 05 How Does BERT Work? • Based on Transformer architecture ( Good at analyzing text) • Uses 'attention' to focus on important parts of sentences • Reads text in both directions simultaneously (bidirectional) Pretraining and Fine-tuning Slide 06 Pretraining and Fine-tuning • Pretraining: Learns basic language patterns from large text data • Fine-tuning: Adjusted for specific tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis) • Adaptable to various NLP applications Applications of BERT Slide 07 Applications of BERT • Question Answering • Text Classification (e.g., spam detection) • Named Entity Recognition (NER) • Sentiment Analysis Why BERT is Special Slide 08 Why BERT is Special • B i d i re c t i o n a l re a d i n g e n a b l e s d e e p e r understanding • Attention mechanism focuses on key words and relationships • Pretrained on large datasets; adaptable to new tasks Using BERT in Codepace Using BERT in your Codepace Slide 09 Installation Import Libraries and Load BERT Sentiment Analysis Slide 10 Question answring Slide 12 Question answring Slide 12 Feature similarity Slide 12 Thank You FORYOURATTENTION
